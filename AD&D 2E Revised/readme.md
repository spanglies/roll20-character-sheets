Ok guys, it's going to be along time before I push another update to Roll20. That being said, if you absolutely must have the latest copy of this sheet:

You can find it here HTML > https://gist.github.com/Project462/87b342d835a25dfbe88ce2dd775822cf <
And here CSS > https://gist.github.com/Project462/76da3d8a4c31af75aaefe73ef68c6c8a <

These will be updated about once a week, so keep checking back. I'll update the versioning too to reflect differences.

**NOTE** This HTMl is unstable and not considered functional at this time. It does have a bunch of cool features, but it should not be used without serious modification. If you don't know how to do that, be patient is all I can ask.

This readme was last updated on 08/09/2017.
