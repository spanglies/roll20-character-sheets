Version 1.0 of Torg Eternity character sheet.

This is loosely based on the original torg sheet, which was in turn based on the basic Fantasy Craft character sheet (thanks to Jason Miller who created it). I've also cobbled together some code from other projects, including the Mongoose Traveller 2nd Ed sheets (for tabs).

I do not claim to be the best sheet deisgner around, by any stretch, and would be glad to hand this project off to anyone who thinks they have a higher level of competence.
