# WH40k Wrath & Glory (Advanced API) Character Sheet

This is a multi-purpose sheet for both characters (default view) and threats based on the quickstart rules (subject to change).  

This Wrath & Glory character sheet provides dice automation for inline dice rolls for any user and is integrated with the Wrath & Glory dice roller API for mentor level gamemasters. 

Please note that the inline dice roll macros do not fully enable the type of dice rolls made in the Wrath & Glory system.  Users will need to hover over the inline roll results to count the number of successes (4 or 5 = 1 success; a 6 = an exalted icon that may be shifted to 2 successes).  At this point it does not add modifiers to the rolls for inline dice.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback (all welcome) please contact Barry at btsnyder@gmail.com
