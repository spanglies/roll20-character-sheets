	"instructions": "This sheet requires two rollables tables, named 'WrathDie' and 'PoolDice', in order for the roll buttons to work. Each rollable table should have the following 6 entries to simulate a six-sided die: value 0, weight 1, 1 pip D6 image (U+2680); value 0, weight 1, 2 pip D6 image (U+2681); value 0, weight 1, 3 pip D6 image (U+2682); value 1, weight 1, 4 pip D6 image (U+2683); value 1, weight 1, 5 pip D6 image (U+2684); and value 2, weight 1, 6 pip D6 image (U+2685). The WrathDie images should be red while the PoolDice images should be any non-red, like black or green. You can roll skills directly from the sheet, by clicking on the corresponding name or the roll button at the beginning of the row. All questions concerning this sheet should be addressed to MattBx8."
