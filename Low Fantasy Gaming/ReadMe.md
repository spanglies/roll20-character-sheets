# Low Fantasy Gaming Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with Low Fantasy Gaming. 

## Features
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates and autocalculates hit and damage values. Users do need to initially insert their attribute modifiers, which are not automatically calculated. It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API. 

### Changelog
* 12 June 2016 original version.

### Credit Where Credit is Due
The CSS and much of the layout is lifted from the excellent work of John Myles ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) and the 5e Dungeons and Dragons sheet.
