	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use with the Returner's Final Fantasy RPG 3rd Edition. The original version of this sheet was designed by John Myles (Actoba on Roll20.net) for DnD_5e. It has been extensively modified and will continue to be updated as necessary. This particular version is designed to automate as much of the combat calculations as possible. This will require all monsters and characters have a sheet in roll20. A non-automated version is available as well. Optional rules for Map Combat and Limit Breaks are fully supported. Sheet help is available on roll20.net from Kiyomi N."
