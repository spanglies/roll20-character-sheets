   "instructions": "#The Quilk System Character Sheet\rThis character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard Quilk System character sheet.\r\r***Attributes***: All Attributes are on the sheet and support rolls from within the character sheet. The roll button is designed to allow the addition of Talent bonuses.\r\r***Talents***: The talent section allows a player to record Talents and the associated bonus for that Talent. The "Power Button" next to the header row can be toggled on/off to allow Attribute, Weapon, and Spell rolls to prompt for the Talent Bonus that should be applied to the roll. If the particular roll should not receive a bonus from a character's Talent list, simply toggle the power button off. When toggled "on," the power button will be maroon, and when toggled "off," the power button will be gray.\r\r***Weapons and Spells***: The character sheet supports adding weapons and spells, and every weapon or spell has a roll button. To utilize that roll button, simply input the formula for the roll. This field should **not** include any of the standard dice rolling callouts (i.e. do **not** encapsulate the roll in square brackets; and do **not** include the "/r")."
