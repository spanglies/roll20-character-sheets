Character sheet for Weaver Dice, based on the superhero webserial by John C. "Wildbow" McCrae,
converted from the original sheet to Roll20 by Andreas J. Help to improve the sheet is welcome.

Version 0.9:

-basic stat tracking capabilities, dynamicly expanding sections for gear and other lists 
-stats can be rolled directly from the sheet
-Cape name moved to be in more in the center
-no help yet with character creation rolls yet
-buttons to roll for skills have not been implemented, as the way skills improve in WD is complex to implement

Possible future improvements:
-implement quick buttons and options to roll skills from sheet
-create power-generation and luck tables so character creation can be made quicker in Roll20
-make the layout more flexible to resizing, it's still quite crude atm
