In progress character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

Styling is inspired primarily by GCS, but also with some influence from the official sheet. The goal was to design a reponsive character sheet that would look good even with a small screen width.


TODO

 - Add option for Language talent to reduce cost.
